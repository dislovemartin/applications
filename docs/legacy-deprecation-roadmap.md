# Legacy Frontend Deprecation Roadmap
## Phase 4.3: Systematic Migration Timeline

**Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: 2025-06-15  
**Scope**: Complete deprecation plan for legacy-frontend components and services  
**Timeline**: 12 days (3 phases + validation)

---

## Migration Strategy Overview

### Approach: Gradual Deprecation with Feature Flags
- **Zero Downtime**: Maintain full operational capability throughout migration
- **Rollback Ready**: Feature flags enable immediate reversion if issues arise
- **Parallel Validation**: Run legacy and shared components simultaneously during transition
- **Risk Mitigation**: Critical components migrated last with extensive testing

### Success Metrics
- **Performance**: <500ms response times maintained
- **Availability**: >99.5% uptime during migration
- **Functionality**: All 5 governance workflows operational
- **Quantumagi**: Solana devnet deployment fully preserved
